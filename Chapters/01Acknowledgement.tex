I would like to express my deepest thanks to Prof. Nowostawski for giving me the opportunity to work on these topics and for his constant and valuable support. Additionally, I would like to thank NTNU for hosting me during the final year of my university studies.

My sincere thanks also go to Prof. Gatteschi for her precious availability to assist me in this thesis work.

Thanks to all the people who have supported me during these university years, including my classmates, colleagues from the Policumbent team, Erasmus friends, and lifelong friends. 

A big thank you goes to my parents, who always believed in me and gave me all possible means to pursue my dreams.

Finally, thanks to Greta, with whom I shared this challenging yet beautiful university journey.
