I would like to express my deepest thanks to Prof. Nowostawski for giving me the opportunity to work on these topics and for his constant and helpful support. Furthermore, I would like to thank NTNU for hosting me during the last year of my university studies.

My sincere thanks also go to Prof. Gatteschi for her precious availability to assist me in this thesis work.

Thanks to all the people who have supported me during these university years. My classmates, my colleagues from the Policumbent team, the Erasmus friends and my lifelong friends. 

A big thank you goes to my parents, who always believed in me and gave me all possible means to pursue my dreams.

Finally, thanks to Greta, the person with who I shared this difficult, but beautiful, university journey.
