Before diving into technical details, I would like to try explaining why the blockchain technology was born. From a merely performance perspective, this technology doesn't make any sense: it's a network with thousands, or even millions depending on the blockchain considered, computers doing the exact same calculations instead of working in parallel on different tasks. So, why was this technology born if it is so expensive to run? To understand this, it's essential to understand what problem it solves.
