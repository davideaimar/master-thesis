	abstract = {Dgraph is a distributed graph database which provides horizontal scalability, distributed cluster-wide ACID transactions, low-latency arbitrary-depth joins, synchronous replication, high availability and crash resilience. Aimed at real-time transactional workloads, Dgraph shards and stores data in a way to optimize joins and traversals, while still providing data retrieval and aggregation. Dgraph’s unique take is to provide low-latency arbitrary-depth joins in a constant number of network calls (typically, just one network call) that would be required to execute a single join, irrespective of the size of the cluster or the size of the result set.},

	abstract = {Ethereum is the largest blockchain platform supporting smart contracts with the second biggest market capitalization. Ethereum data can yield many useful insights because of the large volume of transactions, accounts and blocks as well as the popular applications developed as smart contracts. Studying Ethereum data can also reveal many new attacks to the platform and its smart contracts. Unfortunately, it is non-trivial to systematically explore Ethereum because it involves massive heterogeneous data, which are produced and stored in different ways. Although a few recent studies report some interesting observations about Ethereum, they are limited by their data acquisition methods which cannot provide comprehensive and precise data. In this paper, to ﬁll the gap, we propose DataEther, a systematic and high-ﬁdelity data exploration framework for Ethereum by exploiting its internal mechanisms. Besides supporting the analyses in existing studies, DataEther further empowers users to explore unknown phenomena and obtain in-depth understandings. We ﬁrst describe how we tackle the challenging issues in developing DataEther, and then use four data-centric applications to demonstrate its usage and report many new observations.},

	abstract = {Blockchain-based cryptocurrencies have received extensive attention recently. Massive data has been stored on permission-less blockchains. The analysis on massive blockchain data can bring huge business values. However, the lack of well-processed up-to-date blockchain datasets impedes big data analytics of blockchain data. To ﬁll this gap, we collect and process the up-to-date on-chain data from Ethereum, which is one of the most popular permission-less blockchains. We name these well-processed Ethereum datasets as XBlock-ETH, which consists of the data of blockchain transactions, smart contracts, and cryptocurrencies (i.e., tokens). The basic statistics and exploration of these datasets are presented. We also outline the possible research opportunities. The datasets with the raw data and codes have been publicly released online.},

	abstract = {Blockchains store a massive amount of heterogeneous data which will only grow in time. When searching for data on the Ethereum platform, one is required to either access the records (blocks) directly by using a unique identifier, or sequentially search several records to find the desired information. Therefore, we propose the Ethereum Query Language (EQL), a query language that allows users to retrieve information from the blockchain by writing SQL-like queries. The queries provide a rich syntax to specify data elements to search information scattered through several records. We claim that EQL makes it easier to search, acquire, format, and present information from the blockchain.},
