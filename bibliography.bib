    title = {Dgraph: {Synchronously} {Replicated}, {Transactional} and {Distributed} {Graph} {Database}},
    abstract = {Dgraph is a distributed graph database which provides horizontal scalability, distributed cluster-wide ACID transactions, low-latency arbitrary-depth joins, synchronous replication, high availability and crash resilience. Aimed at real-time transactional workloads, Dgraph shards and stores data in a way to optimize joins and traversals, while still providing data retrieval and aggregation. Dgraph’s unique take is to provide low-latency arbitrary-depth joins in a constant number of network calls (typically, just one network call) that would be required to execute a single join, irrespective of the size of the cluster or the size of the result set.},

    abstract = {Blockchains store a massive amount of heterogeneous data which will only grow in time. When searching for data on the Ethereum platform, one is required to either access the records (blocks) directly by using a unique identifier, or sequentially search several records to find the desired information. Therefore, we propose the Ethereum Query Language (EQL), a query language that allows users to retrieve information from the blockchain by writing SQL-like queries. The queries provide a rich syntax to specify data elements to search information scattered through several records. We claim that EQL makes it easier to search, acquire, format, and present information from the blockchain.},
